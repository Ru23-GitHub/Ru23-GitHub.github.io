          <h4 class = "handwritten" style = "padding-top: 10px;"> Who are you? ðŸ¤” </h4>
          <p style = "font-size: 90%;">Uh I literally just said "Hi, I'm Ruslan" up above. Well...I guess I could get more specific. My name is <b>Ruslan Manoharan</b>, my pronouns are <b>he/him/his</b>, and I'm a <b>Junior Computer Science student</b> at the University of California, Irvine! (Zot Zot Zot!) Right now I reside in <b>Irvine, CA</b> for school, but originally I'm from the great city of <b>Portland, OR!</b></p>
          <h4 class = "handwritten"> What do you do? ðŸ’» </h4>
          <p style = "font-size: 90%;">Well, as a CompSci student, I do CompSci stuff! Specifically, I'm learning to be and working as a fullstack developer, and currently I'm diving deeper into the fields of machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence. I'm also exploring information retrieval topics and frontend design topics.</p>
          <h4 class = "handwritten"> What else do you do? ðŸ¥‹ </h4>
          <p style = "font-size: 90%;">Yep, I do do things other than CompSci! In my free time I enjoy travelling the world, taking photos and making fun little videos, flying my drone, trying to cook, eating lots and lots of food, running, practicing taekwondo, pretending I can sing, watching MCU movies, playing Nintendo games, and just making people laugh XD.</p>
          <h4 class = "handwritten"> What are you looking for? ðŸ‘€ </h4>
          <p style = "font-size: 90%;">I enjoy Computer Science because I believe it gives me the capability to reach and assist others at a scale that other occupations couldn't reach. With that said, I'm looking for backend or frontend work experiences to help broaden my understanding of industry operations and further hone my skills, as well as allow myself to assist teams with my skillset to develop quality products for clientele!</p>
